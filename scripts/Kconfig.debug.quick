config DEBUG_FAST_RUNTIME
	string "Fast test and pre-condition runtime value"
	default "1s"
	help
	  If 1s is set, this sets the fio runtime=1s value -- 1 second for
	  both tests and pre-conditioning.

	  If you want to debug run time you may wish to enable this to force
	  runtime for tests and pre-conditioning to be reduced to a bare
	  minimum.

	  Tell fio to terminate pre-conditioning after the specified period
	  of time. Use a small value when debugging real runs.

	  By default pre-conditioning will run until it determines the drive
	  is ready. You can use this to override this mechanism and stop it
	  earlier.

	  Supported input values are can be in hours, minutes, or seconds.

	  For more details on runtime refer to the fio(1) manpage.

config DEBUG_ACTIVE_RANGE
	string "Debug active range setting"
	default "4096k"
	help
	  This reduces the active range of the drive when debugging to a short
	  value. This will ensure only this amount of the drive is used. This is
	  useful to mimic a quick full drive pre-fill.

config DEBUG_SHORT_LOOP
	bool "Shorten prefill loop count"
	default y
	help
	  If enabled will force a short prefill loop.

config DEBUG_ROUND_CRITICAL_LIMIT
	string "Steady state round critical limit"
	default "1"
	help
	  The default maximum amount of rounds to run the workload dependent
	  pre-conditioning when quick defaults are enabled.

config DEBUG_ROUND_MIN_COUNT
	string "Steady state round minimum count"
	default "1"
	help
	  The default minumum amount of rounds which are needed to succeed
	  for SNIA tests when in debug mode.
